Problem Statement:
In India, most people use multiple bank accounts across different banks. Currently, there is no single platform where users can view and manage all their bank accounts together.
This makes it difficult to:
1)Track total money across banks
2)Monitor expenses
3)Manage personal finances easily.

Solution:
This project proposes a single platform that allows users to connect multiple bank accounts and view their financial information in one place.
The platform uses a centralized backend and APIs to collect and display data from different banking platforms.

Features:
1)User registration and login
2)Connect multiple bank accounts (mock data)
3)View total balance from all accounts
4)View transaction history
5)Simple and user-friendly dashboard

Technologies Used:
1)Frontend: React.js
2)Backend: Node.js, Express.js
3)Database: MongoDB
4)Authentication: JWT

This project is designed for the Indian banking system and can be extended in the future to work with:
1)Indian banks
2)UPI-based transactions
3)Account Aggregator systems

Future Scope:
1)Real bank API integration
2)Expense categorization
3)Budget tracking
4)Mobile application
